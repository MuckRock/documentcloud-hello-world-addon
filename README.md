# DocumentCloud Hello World Add-On

This repository contains an example Add-On for DocumentCloud.  It is designed
to be copied and modified to allow one to easily write Add-Ons to bring custom
functionality to DocumentCloud.  Please use the green "Use this Template"
button to create a new repository instead of forking.  This will be easier as
the new Add-On will diverge significantly from this code base.

After copying the template, remember to update this README file to describe
your new Add-On!  It is a good idea to leave the link to the Add-On
documentation at the top of the file though.
